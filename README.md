# Bio_CostCurves
Scripts used to generate results as published in the journal Nature Climate Change titled 'Climate change impacts on renewable energy supply'. 

 Developed by:
Monique Hoogwijk January 2004, Detlef van Vuuren 2005-2008, Jasper van Vliet, Vassilis Daioglou 2014-2015 - Added non-woody crops, calculation of residues

This script describes the yield area curve of woody and non-woody short rotation energy crops, maize and sugar cane. In the IMAGE-TIMER model, these curve will be converted into cost-supply curves. The study of the potential assessment and the costs is described in Hoogwijk, Faaij, Eickhout, de Vries, Turkenburg and in Hoogwijk, Faaij, de Vries, Turkenburg, 2004 as well as in thesis Hoogwijk (2004) 

Furthermore, this module decribes the available potential of agricultural and forestry residues. These include harvest and process residues. Potentials based on agricultural and forestry production volumes and intensities. Theoretical, ecological and available potentials determined. Cost curves determined based on harvest, collection and trasnport costs. Method described in: Daioglou, Stehfest, Wicke, Faaij, van Vuuren, 2015, Projections of the availability and cost reduction from agriculture and forestry, GCB Bioenergy

Main scipt is b2t27.m. The model language is MyM see https://www.my-m.eu/ and https://models.pbl.nl/image/index.php/Welcome_to_IMAGE_3.0_Documentation
